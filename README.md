# ChronoScore

Welcome to ChronoScore, a cutting-edge real-time leaderboard system designed to handle massive scale and deliver instantaneous results. This project tackles the complex challenges of building and maintaining a high-performance leaderboard in a dynamic environment.

## Overview

Designing a real-time leaderboard system is no small feat. It involves balancing performance, scalability, and data consistency. With ChronoScore, we dive deep into the intricacies of real-time data processing and present a robust solution for online platforms where user engagement and rewards drive success.

### Scenario

Imagine an online gaming platform with the following requirements:

- **Active Users**: 50 million
- **Daily Active Users**: 10 million
- **Leaderboard Update**: Real-time or near real-time
- **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency is acceptable
- **Display**: Top 10 users and their ranks

Our goal is to create a system that efficiently processes and displays the top performers, even under high load conditions.

## System Design

### Challenges

1. **High Load Handling**: With millions of daily active users, the system must handle a significant volume of updates and queries without performance degradation.
2. **Real-Time Updates**: Ensuring that the leaderboard reflects the latest user scores instantly or within a near-real-time window.
3. **Scalability**: The system should scale horizontally to accommodate growing user numbers and data.

### Design Overview

- **Database Design**: We use PostgreSQL for its reliability and performance. The core tables include:
  - **`user_score`**: Stores user scores.
  - **`users`**: Contains user profile information.

  These tables are designed to support efficient querying and updates, essential for real-time operations.

- **System Architecture**: The architecture is optimized for high throughput and low latency, using a combination of caching, asynchronous processing, and efficient querying techniques.

### Key Components

- **Data Aggregation**: Implemented to aggregate user scores and calculate rankings efficiently.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Utilizes streaming technologies and event-driven architecture to ensure timely updates.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale both vertically and horizontally, adapting to varying load conditions.
